# Gender-Classification

We have to create a model for classifying the input data into male/female using the given data set..

We need to create a pipeline such that If any change(add/modify records in the data) in the dataset then the pre-processing/training part of the model gets kicked off. Otherwise it should be possible to launch only the inference of the model to classify the new data input.
